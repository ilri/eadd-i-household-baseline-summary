# EADD phase I baseline synthesis report: Nandi, Kenya

This reposity provides a set of scripts to reproduce a report on household and farm dynamics of farming households in Nandi, Kenya.

The scripts require the East African Dairy Development baseline dataset [(request through the ILRI portal)](http://data.ilri.org/portal/) from 2009, and R with the appropriate packages installed.

There are several guides for setting up R for creating reproducible documents using the KnitR package [(for example)](https://danieljhocking.wordpress.com/2013/09/25/knitting-beautiful-documents-in-rstudio/)
